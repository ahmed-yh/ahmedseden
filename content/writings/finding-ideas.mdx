# Finding Ideas Worth Writing About

The question I get asked most often is: "Where do you find things to write about?" The answer is both simple and complex—ideas are everywhere, but noticing them requires practice.

## The Art of Noticing

Most ideas come from paying attention to friction <Footnote id="1">Friction is the gap between how things are and how they could be. Every improvement starts with noticing this gap.</Footnote>. When something confuses you, frustrates you, or delights you unexpectedly—that's signal.

I keep a running note called "Questions I'm Curious About" that I add to whenever something piques my interest. Most entries never become essays, but having this list means I'm never short on starting points.

## Sources of Inspiration

My ideas typically come from a few consistent sources:

### Reading Widely

I read across disciplines—philosophy, science, design, fiction. The most interesting ideas often emerge at intersections, where concepts from one field illuminate problems in another.

### Conversations

Talking with people who think differently than I do is invaluable. Their questions often reveal blind spots in my thinking, and their perspectives offer new angles on familiar topics.

### Personal Experience

Some of my best writing comes from reflecting on my own experiences—projects I've worked on, decisions I've made, mistakes I've learned from. Personal experience gives writing authenticity and specificity.

## The Importance of Capture

Ideas are fleeting. Without a system to capture them, most will be lost. I use a simple note-taking app synced across devices, so I can jot down thoughts wherever I am.

The key isn't the tool—it's the habit. Make capturing ideas frictionless enough that you actually do it consistently.

## From Ideas to Essays

Not every idea becomes an essay. In fact, most don't. But having a large collection of seeds means I always have something to develop when I sit down to write.

The transformation from idea to essay typically follows this path:

1. **Capture** — Write down the initial thought
2. **Expand** — Add context, examples, and related ideas
3. **Connect** — Link to other thoughts in the garden
4. **Develop** — Shape into a coherent argument or narrative
5. **Refine** — Edit for clarity and flow

## Trust the Process

The most important thing I've learned about finding ideas is that it's a practice, not a talent. The more you notice, the more you'll notice. The more you write, the more you'll have to write about.

Start small. Pay attention. Let curiosity guide you.
