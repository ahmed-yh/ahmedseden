# The Philosophy of Digital Gardens

A digital garden is fundamentally different from a blog. While blogs present polished, timestamped posts in reverse chronological order, gardens are spaces where ideas grow, evolve, and connect over time.

This concept draws from the work of Mike Caulfield, who popularized the metaphor of "the garden and the stream" in digital writing.

## Seeds, Sprouts, and Evergreens

In my garden, I categorize notes by their maturity:

- **Seeds** are raw ideas, barely formed <Footnote id="1">These often come from reading, conversations, or sudden insights during walks.</Footnote>
- **Sprouts** are developing thoughts with some structure
- **Evergreens** are fully developed essays that I maintain over time

## Why Gardens Over Blogs?

Traditional blogging creates pressure to publish "finished" work. But thinking is iterative. Gardens embrace this reality—they're designed for revision, connection, and growth.

The beauty of a garden is that an idea planted today might connect with something written months ago, creating unexpected relationships between concepts.

<Callout type="tip">
Start your own garden by writing about what genuinely interests you, without worrying about polish or audience. The connections will emerge naturally.

## Tending the Garden

Like physical gardens, digital ones require regular tending:

1. **Weeding** — removing outdated or irrelevant notes
2. **Watering** — adding new thoughts to existing ideas
3. **Pruning** — refining language and structure
4. **Planting** — introducing new seeds

This ongoing maintenance is what distinguishes a garden from an archive. It's a living system, not a static collection.

## The Value of Imperfection

One of the most liberating aspects of digital gardening is accepting imperfection. Not every thought needs to be complete. Not every connection needs to be obvious. The garden is a space for thinking in public, which means embracing the messy, iterative nature of thought itself.
