# **He who sees too much ends up not fitting anywhere**

there's a specific kind of torment that comes with being too aware of your surroundings. It's not about being smart but about seeing too much; once you start spotting the patterns there is no going back.

Everyone is acting out parts they don't even realize they are acting out and conversations seems staged.

Do you even recall a time when you could simply enjoy the moment without observing yourself? The worst part about all of this is the isolation that comes with it. Everyone is living while you're gazing.

They're immersed in experiences that you can only witness from the outside. Because you can only act out of reason instead of emotion, your brain cannot fathom the ability of doing things without judging thyself in the third person.

So you keep quiet and pretend you don't see the strings.
