# My Writing Process

Writing is thinking made visible. Over years of practice, I've developed a process that helps me move from scattered thoughts to coherent essays. Here's how it works.

## Phase 1: Research and Marination

Before I write a single word, I spend time with the topic. This usually involves:

- Reading relevant books and articles
- Taking notes in my own words
- Having conversations about the topic
- Just thinking during walks or quiet moments

<Callout type="info">
I call this phase "marination" because the goal is to let ideas soak in and connect naturally, rather than forcing a structure prematurely.
</Callout>

## Phase 2: The Messy First Draft

The first draft is always terrible, and that's the point <Footnote id="1">Anne Lamott calls this the "shitty first draft" in Bird by Bird. The key insight is that all good writers write bad first drafts.</Footnote>. I write fast and messy, trying to get ideas on the page without judgment.

During this phase, I often:

- Write in fragments and bullet points
- Leave placeholders like [ADD EXAMPLE HERE]
- Skip sections I'm stuck on and come back later
- Talk out loud to myself when I can't find the words

## Phase 3: Structure and Organization

Once I have raw material, I step back and look at the shape of the piece. What's the main argument? What order makes sense? What's missing?

I rearrange sections, identify gaps, and create an outline that guides revision. This is where the essay starts to take form.

## Phase 4: Revision

Revision is where writing happens. I typically go through 3-5 revision passes, each with a different focus:

1. **Content pass** — Is everything accurate and relevant?
2. **Structure pass** — Does the flow make sense?
3. **Clarity pass** — Is each sentence clear?
4. **Style pass** — Does it sound like me?
5. **Polish pass** — Grammar, punctuation, formatting

<Callout type="tip">
Reading your work aloud is the single most effective editing technique I know. Your ear catches what your eye misses.
</Callout>

## Phase 5: Rest and Fresh Eyes

Before publishing, I let the piece rest for at least 24 hours. Coming back with fresh eyes almost always reveals improvements I couldn't see when I was deep in the work.

## Tools and Environment

My writing stack is deliberately simple:

- **Drafting**: Plain text in Obsidian
- **Editing**: Same document, multiple passes
- **Publishing**: Copy to the blog platform

I write best in the morning, with coffee, in silence. Your ideal conditions may differ—experiment to find what works.

## The Importance of Routine

Writing regularly is more important than writing brilliantly. I aim to write something—anything—every day. Some days it's a full essay. Most days it's just a few notes. But the habit compounds over time.

Process matters because it removes friction. When you know how you write, you spend less energy figuring out what to do and more energy actually doing it.
